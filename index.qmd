### Hi! {style="color: black"}

::: {#about}
Welcome to my home page. I am currently a final year Ph.D. student in the Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics at Monash University, supervised by [Professor Gael M. Martin](https://users.monash.edu.au/~gmartin/), [Professor David T. Frazier](https://dtfrazier.netlify.app/) and [Dr. Ruben Loaiza-Maya](https://sites.google.com/view/rubenloaizamaya/your-page-title). I am currently working on developing a novel Approximate Bayesian Computation method which delivers inferences that are more robust to model misspecification.

I am also working as a teaching associate in the Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics at Monash University.
